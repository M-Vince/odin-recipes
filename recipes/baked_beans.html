    <h1>Better Baked Beans</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Tangy, sweet, old-fashioned baked beans are made the easy way using canned
      beans. This is my grandma's favorite semi-homemade recipe. She makes it
      every Thanksgiving, and we usually end up scraping the pan clean! There
      are never any leftovers.
